<strong>Example Input</strong>

01011011011110

<strong>Example Output</strong>
0
1
2
4

* <strong>Explanation</strong>
	* Example case 1: Since all seats are empty, the number of groups is 0.

	* Example case 2: Since only one seat is occupied, the number of groups is 1.

	* Example case 3: Here, two seats are occupied, but since they are not adjacent, the people sitting on them belong to different groups.

	* Example case 4: Here, we have 4 groups of friends with size 1, 2, 2 and 4 respectively. That is, first group is sitting at 2nd seat, second group at 4th and 5th seat, third group at 7th and 8th seat and fourth group at 10th to 13th seat.
